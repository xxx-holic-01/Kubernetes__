# Kubernetes__
Kubernetes is composed of several key components that work together to manage containerized applications.
Here are some pointers you must remember while working with Kubernetes.

ðŸ’ Master Components:
â–ª API Server: Exposes the Kubernetes API and serves as the entry point for managing the cluster.
â–ª Controller Manager: Monitors the cluster's state and ensures that the desired state is maintained. It includes controllers for nodes, replication, endpoints, and more.
â–ª Scheduler: Assigns workloads to nodes based on resource requirements and constraints.

ðŸ’ Node Components:
â–ª Kubelet: Agent running on each node that communicates with the API server and manages containers on the node.
â–ª Container Runtime: Software responsible for running containers, such as Docker or containerd.
ðŸ’ Kube Proxy: Maintains network rules to allow communication between pods and external traffic.
ðŸ’  Controller Plane:
Etcd: A distributed key-value store that stores the cluster's configuration data and state.
ðŸ’ Pods:
â–ª Basic Building Block: Smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers sharing the same network namespace.
